# Comparison of MATHUSLA and SHiP Experiments in Long-Lived Particle Searches

## Introduction

Long-lived particles (LLPs) offer a compelling avenue for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), potentially addressing key questions like the nature of dark matter, neutrino masses, or the baryon asymmetry. Two major proposed experiments at CERN - **MATHUSLA** (Massive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra-Stable Particles) and **SHiP** (Search for Hidden Particles) - are dedicated to LLP searches but with different approaches. **MATHUSLA** is a planned large-volume detector on the surface adjacent to the HL-LHC collider (near the CMS interaction point), aiming to catch neutral LLP decays from \$pp\$ collisions. **SHiP**, in contrast, is a proposed fixed-target **beam dump** experiment at the SPS, designed to produce and detect feebly interacting particles in a controlled intensity-frontier setting. Both experiments are optimized for *complementary regimes* of new physics. This report compares their physics goals, sensitivity reach, benchmark models, detector designs, and how they complement other experiments.

## Physics Goals and Targeted New Physics

**MATHUSLA’s primary goal** is to **extend the HL-LHC’s discovery potential** for neutral, long-lived BSM particles that decay outside the main detectors. It targets scenarios where the LHC detectors have limited reach, for example: medium-mass LLPs (\~10-100 GeV) that decay hadronically at long distances, or other neutral LLPs that decay with displaced vertices in the far field. These include many **hidden-sector particles** produced in high-energy collisions. A key motivation is to cover "blind spots" in LHC searches - e.g. **neutral naturalness** models (such as Folded SUSY or Twin Higgs) predicting \$\mathcal{O}(10)\$ GeV hadronic LLPs (like long-lived "dark glueballs") from exotic Higgs decays. Such LLPs could be missed by ATLAS/CMS due to trigger and background limitations, but **MATHUSLA can observe their decays in a low-background environment**. In general, MATHUSLA is optimized for new physics that leverages the **full 14 TeV collision energy** and enormous HL-LHC production rates, but with decays occurring on the order of tens to hundreds of meters from the interaction point. This covers scenarios like exotic Higgs decays to hidden-sector states, neutral long-lived SUSY particles (e.g. neutralinos with R-parity violation), or other high-mass LLPs that would travel outside the main detectors before decaying. (Notably, MATHUSLA also provides a detection channel for certain cosmic-ray events or exotic cosmic phenomena, though its design is driven by collider physics.)

**SHiP’s physics program** is twofold, encompassing **both BSM searches and neutrino physics**. Its primary BSM goal is to probe the **"hidden sector" at the GeV mass scale**, i.e. particles with **feeble couplings** that are produced in high-intensity proton collisions and decay invisibly or outside traditional detectors. SHiP’s beam dump will produce an enormous flux of heavy mesons (\$c\$, \$b\$ hadrons) and other particles; the experiment is optimized to catch decays of light LLPs emerging from those decays. Key targets explicitly include:

* **Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs)** (sterile neutrinos) in the \$\sim\$0.1-5 GeV/\$c^2\$ range, which could explain neutrino masses and leptogenesis. SHiP is designed to **fully explore** the viable HNL parameter space in this mass range - for example, covering essentially all mixing angles down to the "see-saw limit" near 1 GeV.
* **Dark Photons and Dark Scalars:** light vector or scalar mediators coupling through the vector-portal or Higgs-portal. These could connect to dark matter or other hidden states. SHiP will seek visible decays of dark photons (e.g. \$A' \to e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-\$) in the MeV-GeV mass range, and similarly for light scalars mixing with the Higgs.
* **Axion-Like Particles (ALPs):** pseudoscalars that couple via heavy scales. SHiP can probe ALPs in the \~MeV-GeV range decaying to photons or leptons.
* **Other feebly-interacting scenarios:** e.g. **inelastic dark matter** (multi-component light DM, where a heavier state decays to a lighter DM plus visible particles), or even low-mass supersymmetric particles (e.g. long-lived neutralinos in the few-GeV range).

In summary, SHiP broadly targets **"FIPs" (Feebly Interacting Particles)** with masses in the \$\mathcal{O}(0.1-10)\$ GeV range that could be produced in the intense 400 GeV proton beam dump. It also includes a **neutrino detector** to study an unrivaled flux of \$\nu\_\tau\$ and \$\bar\nu\_\tau\$, aiming for first direct observation of tau anti-neutrinos and precision \$\nu\_\tau\$ cross-sections. (This **neutrino physics program** is a bonus distinguishing SHiP from MATHUSLA, which has no analogous SM program.)

**Coverage of the new physics landscape:** There is a clear complementarity: **MATHUSLA** excels for higher-mass LLPs (tens to hundreds of GeV) produced at the energy frontier, especially those decaying to hadronic final states, while **SHiP** excels for lower-mass LLPs (MeV to few GeV) at the intensity frontier. Indeed, the few-GeV mass range (for any decay mode) is *explicitly* a domain where SHiP will provide coverage that LHC experiments (even with MATHUSLA) cannot. Conversely, certain BSM scenarios like neutral naturalness or exotic Higgs decays yield **medium-mass LLPs that require the HL-LHC’s energy** and a large decay volume - the core niche of MATHUSLA. Both experiments together thus address a broad swath of LLP parameter space that is otherwise inaccessible.

## Sensitivity to Long-Lived Particles: Lifetime and Mass Reach

**MATHUSLA’s sensitivity** is characterized by extremely long lifetimes and moderate-to-high masses. By situating a detector ~~\$100~~\text{m}\$ from the collision point with a large fiducial volume, MATHUSLA can detect particles that travel tens to hundreds of meters before decaying. In terms of proper lifetime (\$c\tau\$), this roughly corresponds to lifetimes up to order \$10^{-5}\$-\$10^{-3}\$ seconds (depending on boost), spanning distances from the LHC cavern to the surface. In fact, **MATHUSLA can observe decays of LLPs with mean decay lengths of order 100 m up to even \$\sim\$1 km**, provided some fraction decay in the detector volume. This extends the reach of HL-LHC searches by **1-2 orders of magnitude in proper lifetime** for many models. Equivalently, at long lifetimes MATHUSLA can probe production **rates (cross-section times branching ratio)** about *10-100 times smaller* than what ATLAS/CMS could at best achieve. For example, in a benchmark scenario of exotic Higgs decays to LLPs, the MATHUSLA detector (40 m scale design) could exclude branching ratios an order of magnitude or two lower than HL-LHC ATLAS/CMS projections, for LLP lifetimes in the 10-100 m range. Its reach far outperforms even dedicated LHC cavern experiments like the smaller CODEX-b proposal. However, MATHUSLA’s sensitivity advantage is most pronounced in the regime of **very long decay lengths** - for shorter lifetimes (e.g. decays inside the main detectors or just outside them), ATLAS/CMS themselves or other smaller detectors might catch the LLP first. In terms of mass, MATHUSLA benefits from the 14 TeV collisions: it can observe LLPs produced in the decays of heavy objects (Higgs, top, exotic resonances up to hundreds of GeV). Practically, its **mass reach extends to the electroweak scale and above** (tens-hundreds of GeV) for models where those heavy LLPs are produced. (By contrast, a light LLP \$<10\$ GeV could be produced at LHC too, but if its coupling is so feeble that it lives long, the production rate might be too small to observe - those cases are better covered by SHiP’s high intensity.)

**SHiP’s sensitivity** is greatest for light particles with tiny couplings (long lifetimes). With \$10^{20}\$ protons on target, SHiP expects to probe new particles with **coupling strengths 2-4 orders of magnitude below** current bounds across a variety of models. The reachable lifetimes are enormous: LLPs decaying in the 50 m decay volume could have proper lifetimes up to **tens of kilometers** in distance. For example, an HNL produced in charm decays could travel \$O(10^4)\$ m (i.e. \$c\tau\$ up to \$\sim 10^{-2}\$-\$10^{-1}\$ s) and still have a chance to decay inside SHiP. Indeed, SHiP can discover HNLs that **travel tens of kilometers before decaying** (for very small mixings), a regime well beyond any existing experiment’s reach. In terms of mass, SHiP is limited by the beam energy and production kinematics - it is most sensitive to LLP masses in the **\$\sim\$0.1-10 GeV/\$c^2\$ range**. Heavy neutral leptons up to a few GeV, dark photons up to \$\sim 10\$ GeV or so, and scalars in a similar range are within reach. Above those masses, production rates from 400 GeV protons (via \$b\$-quark decays, for instance) drop off, so SHiP’s sensitivity to, say, a 50 GeV LLP is quite limited. This is where the **energy frontier experiments (HL-LHC + MATHUSLA)** take over. Conversely, at very low masses (\$<0.1\$ GeV), SHiP can still be powerful - for instance, it can probe dark photons down to MeV-scale masses (produced in rare \$\pi^0\$, \$\eta\$ decays) with couplings beyond \$10^{-5}\$ in kinetic mixing. In summary, **SHiP outperforms collider experiments in the long-lifetime, tiny-coupling regime** for sub-10 GeV particles, offering potential **exclusion improvements of 2-4 orders of magnitude in coupling** relative to current constraints. The experiment is expected not just to discover, but to collect large event samples (hundreds to thousands of decays) if such particles exist in the accessible parameter space. This yields the opportunity for detailed measurements (mass, lifetime, branching fractions) of any discovered particle, a unique strength of SHiP’s **intensity-driven approach**.

Simple, modular design optimized for vertex detection, not momentum measurement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Magnetized spectrometer** with tracking and calorimetry. Features a powerful **muon shield** (magnetic deflectors + absorbers) to sweep out beam-induced muons. A large-aperture dipole magnet (\~0.6-0.8 T·m field integral) and four high-precision tracking stations (straw tubes) measure charged decay products’ momenta. Downstream electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters and muon detectors provide particle ID. Also includes surrounding **veto/tagger detectors** to catch neutrino interactions or random tracks entering the decay volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Background Rejection**    | Relies on **100 m rock overburden** to eliminate LHC collision debris (only neutral LLPs reach surface). **Cosmic-ray muons** are the dominant background; mitigated by *in-situ* measurements and layered vetos to achieve near-zero accidental vertices. Trigger requires **upward-going tracks** coincident in time with an LHC bunch crossing (distinct from downward cosmic rays). Design goal is a **background-free search**, so that observing a handful of decays is significant.                                                                                                                                       | **Neutrino and muon backgrounds** are primary concerns. Uses a **heavy target + hadron absorber** to reduce secondary pion/kaon decays producing neutrinos. The custom muon shield reduces muon flux by many orders of magnitude before the decay volume. Surrounding scintillating tagger detectors identify interactions in or around the vacuum vessel that could mimic signals. Being located underground (in a shielded hall) means **cosmic backgrounds are negligible**. The layered veto + timing systems allow SHiP to also operate in a essentially **background-free regime** for LLP decays.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Signatures & Strengths**  | **Multi-track displaced vertices** in empty volume. Especially strong for **hadronic decay channels** (dark hadrons decaying to jets) which are difficult to trigger on at the LHC. Also capable of detecting LLP decays to charged leptons (e.g. \$e^+e^-\$ pairs) or any visible charged tracks - but no sensitivity to fully neutral final states (photon pairs, neutrinos only, etc.). Can provide a trigger to CMS so that the **originating collision** is recorded for off-line analysis. High discovery potential for Hidden Valley scenarios, exotic Higgs decays, etc., by virtue of large volume and zero background. | **Varied final states**: reconstructs vertices with charged tracks and can also detect photons or \$\pi^0\$ via calorimetry. Excellent capability to measure decay kinematics - momenta, invariant mass, particle ID - allowing **reconstruction of the LLP’s mass** and distinguishing decay modes. Particularly strong for **leptonic channels** (e.g. HNL decays to \$\ell^\pm\pi^\mp\$ or \$\ell^+\ell^-\nu\$) and **electromagnetic decays** (dark photon to \$e^+e^-\$ or \$\mu^+\mu^-\$) which leave clear signals in the spectrometer. Can observe \*\* \~1000 events\*\* for some models, enabling detailed studies (spin determination via decay mode analysis, lifetime measurement, coupling extraction). Also features a **neutrino detector** downstream (emulsion and calorimeter) to separately study \$\nu\_\tau\$ interactions and search for Light Dark Matter scattering. |

## Benchmark Models and Portals - Relative Strengths

Both experiments advertise sensitivity to a wide variety of BSM "portals" - but each has particular strengths for certain theories:

* **Heavy Neutral Leptons (Sterile Neutrinos):** **SHiP** is especially designed for HNLs in the MeV-GeV mass range. It can probe mixings down to \$U^2 \sim 10^{-10}\$-\$10^{-9}\$ and cover nearly the entire parameter space where an HNL could explain the observed neutrino masses via see-saw, including regions that realize leptogenic baryogenesis. With potentially thousands of HNL decays observed, SHiP could even confirm lepton-number-violating channels (like \$N\to \mu^\pm \pi^\mp\$) to test Majorana nature. **MATHUSLA**, in contrast, is less optimized for light HNLs - however, it could detect heavier HNLs (tens of GeV) produced in exotic \$W\$ or \$Z\$ decays if they have displaced decays outside CMS. Its acceptance for HNL signals would be limited and has not been emphasized in MATHUSLA’s physics documents (the focus there is more on LLPs from Higgs/top or exotic cascades). Overall, **HNLs are a flagship target of SHiP**, whereas MATHUSLA would only play a role for HNLs at higher masses or with production mechanisms unique to LHC.

* **Dark Photons (Vector Portal):** **SHiP** has broad coverage for dark photons \$A'\$ in the 1 MeV-\$\sim\$10 GeV range, produced either from rare meson decays (\$\pi^0,\eta,\omega \to \gamma A'\$) or QCD processes in the dump. It can detect \$A' \to e^+e^-\$ or \$\mu^+\mu^-\$ decays with near-zero background. MATHUSLA could in principle detect a dark photon if it decays to \$e^+e^-\$ *after exiting CMS* - but for most of the dark photon parameter space, either the decays are too prompt (for larger couplings) or the production at LHC is too small (for tiny couplings). Dedicated forward detectors like FASER have more competitive reach for very light (\$<1\$ GeV) dark photons produced in LHC collisions. Meanwhile, SHiP’s reach extends to **dark-photon kinetic mixings as low as \$10^{-5}\$-\$10^{-8}\$, depending on mass**, surpassing other experiments in the 0.1-1 GeV range. Thus, for **vector mediators** connecting to dark sectors, SHiP covers the low-mass, small-coupling regime, whereas MATHUSLA would only contribute if a dark photon arises in a heavy (e.g. Higgs) decay with a moderate lifetime.

* **Higgs-Portal Scalars:** If there exists a light scalar \$S\$ mixing with the Higgs (e.g. a "dark Higgs"), SHiP can look for \$S\$ produced in heavy meson decays (like \$B \to X,S\$) or through rare Higgs production in the dump. It has sensitivity to such scalars in the few-GeV mass range and small mixing angles. **MATHUSLA,** on the other hand, would be *exceptionally sensitive if the Higgs boson itself decays to long-lived scalars*. For example, if \$h\to SS\$ with each \$S\$ long-lived, MATHUSLA could catch those decays for \$m\_S\$ up to tens of GeV. The MATHUSLA reach for exotic Higgs decays to LLPs (including scalars or others) is considered an essential addition to the HL-LHC program. In fact, probing exotic Higgs branching fractions at the \$10^{-4}\$-\$10^{-5}\$ level in hidden-sector channels is a key selling point of MATHUSLA. In summary, **MATHUSLA excels for Higgs-portal LLPs if the Higgs is produced at LHC**, whereas **SHiP can probe lighter scalar portals in a more generic intensity-frontier way** (including non-Higgs-related production).

* **Neutral Naturalness (Twin Higgs, Folded SUSY):** These theories predict a Hidden Valley spectrum of long-lived hadrons (like "dark glueballs" of mass a few GeV) produced via exotic Higgs decays. This is a **core scenario for MATHUSLA** - it can observe multiple displaced decays of such hidden hadrons, providing a striking signal with negligible background. SHiP would not be able to produce these states in significant numbers, since they rely on the 125 GeV Higgs boson as a source (which is barely produced in a 400 GeV beam dump). Thus, **neutral naturalness is almost exclusively covered by MATHUSLA (and the main LHC detectors to a lesser extent)**. A successful MATHUSLA detection of several dark glueball decays, for instance, could confirm this class of theories.

* **Supersymmetry with Long Lifetimes:** Both experiments have some reach into long-lived SUSY scenarios, but in different regimes. **MATHUSLA** could detect, for example, an R-parity-violating neutralino of mass \~100 GeV that is long-lived: it might be produced in LHC collisions and decay in the MATHUSLA volume (a scenario main detectors struggle with if the decay is outside their volume). **SHiP** could hunt for much lighter SUSY remnants - e.g. a light neutralino or sgoldstino in the GeV range produced in meson decays. If the SUSY breaking scale is low, some superpartners might lie in the GeV mass domain; SHiP can probe those via their feeble couplings. In short, **MATHUSLA covers "soft" long-lived SUSY signals tied to the LHC’s high energy**, whereas SHiP covers **"mini-SUSY" scenarios** at lower mass with tiny couplings.

* **Dark Matter and Millicharged Particles:** SHiP also has a component to search for light Dark Matter particles produced in the beam dump (e.g. via dark photons) scattering in its neutrino detector. It can detect **inelastic dark matter** via a characteristic twin-signature: scattering in the neutrino calorimeter followed by a delayed decay in the main decay volume. It can even look for **millicharged particles** via multiple scattering ("double-scattering signature") in a proposed added detector. MATHUSLA is not suited for direct dark matter detection (it cannot see invisible particles at all, only decays into visible states). It *could* detect a millicharged particle if it produced ionization in the air volume, but its scintillator is tuned for relativistic charged tracks, and dedicated millicharge experiments (like milliQan at LHC) are more appropriate. So in this domain - light stable dark sector particles - SHiP and other beam experiments have the edge, whereas MATHUSLA’s contribution would only come indirectly (via visible decays of unstable dark sector states).

## Detector Design and Geometry

Despite both being "LLP detectors," the designs of MATHUSLA and SHiP differ fundamentally due to their environments:

**MATHUSLA** is essentially a **giant above-ground decay volume** placed near an LHC interaction point. The current design ("MATHUSLA40") is a **40 m × 40 m footprint building, 11 m tall**, located roughly 100 m from the CMS collision point (point 5) on the surface. The detector is an empty air volume where LLPs can decay, surrounded by detector elements: the **ceiling** is instrumented with a grid of scintillator tracker modules (16 modules, each 9 m × 9 m, containing 6 layers of plastic scintillator bars), and the **rear wall** (farthest from CMS) has additional 6-layer tracking modules. Each scintillator bar is read out with SiPMs for precise timing (σ \~1 ns) and position resolution \~1 cm in one dimension. The scintillator layers detect charged particles from an LLP decay, and by layering, the system can reconstruct an approximate vertex in the air volume. **No magnetic field is used** - momentum is not measured; instead, MATHUSLA acts as a pure decay vertex detector. The design incorporates extensive **veto systems**: a double-layer "hermetic" veto on the floor and on the front wall (facing the IP) catches downward-going cosmic muons and any upward-traveling particles from the LHC that penetrate the rock. The combination of floor, wall, and roof segmentation allows MATHUSLA to differentiate an **upward-moving decay shower** (signal from below, i.e. the LHC) from a downward cosmic ray track. **Background suppression** is central - the detector is engineered such that, after vetos, **any genuine multi-track vertex observed in the volume is essentially new physics**. Importantly, MATHUSLA will be synchronized with the LHC clock: the timing of a candidate decay can be correlated with a specific bunch crossing in CMS. In a discovery, this means MATHUSLA can send a trigger to CMS to read out the full event record, potentially enabling a "timestamp" for the LLP’s production (e.g. one could look for companion objects or missing energy in CMS for that bunch crossing). The simplicity of MATHUSLA’s design (scintillator + tracking layers in a building) makes it a relatively low-cost add-on, but it **sacrifices detailed reconstruction** (no energy measurement or charge/momentum separation). Its geometric acceptance is biased to **large-angle LLP decays** (those that emerge upward/outward into the surface) - roughly covering pseudo-rapidity \$\eta \sim 0\$ to \$2\$ for decays, and it sits off to the side of CMS to avoid the busiest muon spray lines. MATHUSLA’s design has evolved to meet civil engineering constraints (height limits, etc.), leading to the current 40 m modular design that could potentially be expanded or staged as needed.

**SHiP**, by contrast, is a **dedicated underground complex** built around a high-intensity beam line. The layout begins with a very dense **target** (likely a hybrid molybdenum/tungsten target) to absorb \$4\times10^{19}\$ protons/year and produce a cascade of secondaries. Immediately downstream is a massive **hadron absorber** or beam dump that ranges out pions/kaons and softens the particle flux. Following that is the **muon shield** - a sequence of magnetized iron components and perhaps active elements - which deflects or absorbs the flood of muons produced in the dump. This shield is crucial: on the order of \$10^{11}\$ muons per spill can be produced, and SHiP’s goal is to reduce that by over \$10^6\$-\$10^7\$ so that only \$\mathcal{O}(1)\$ muon enters the detector per spill. After the shield comes the **decay volume**, which is a **large evacuated or helium-filled vessel** about *50 m long*. It has a transverse size on the order of a few meters (the exact design aperture is chosen to capture the angular spread of signal particles while remaining narrow enough for the shield to be effective - a cross-section roughly 5 m high and 10 m wide is indicated by magnet aperture requirements). The decay volume is kept as empty as possible (helium at near-vacuum density) to avoid neutrino interactions or multiple scattering. Surrounding this volume and at its ends are **background tagger** detectors - for example, timing planes or calorimeters that can detect if a neutrino interaction occurred in the walls, which could produce a secondary particle that looks like a decay. At the downstream end of the vacuum vessel is the **spectrometer**: a large dipole magnet (aperture \~5 m × 10 m) that houses tracking detectors. SHiP’s tracking system consists of four high-precision tracking stations (likely straw-tube drift chambers, each station just \~0.5% \$X\_0\$ to minimize scattering). Two stations are before the magnet, two after, allowing momentum reconstruction of charged tracks. The magnet provides a modest bending (integral \~0.7 T·m) sufficient for measuring momenta in the few-GeV range. Downstream of tracking, SHiP has an **electromagnetic calorimeter**, a **hadronic calorimeter**, and a **muon detector system**, to identify particle types and measure energies. For instance, electrons will shower in the ECAL, muons will penetrate to the muon chambers, etc., enabling identification of decay modes (e.g. distinguishing \$e^+e^-\$ vs \$\mu^+\mu^-\$ vs \$\pi^+\pi^-\$). Finally, beyond the main decay spectrometer, SHiP includes a **Scattering and Neutrino Detector (SND)** - typically envisioned as a compact emulsion cloud chamber followed by a muonized calorimeter. This SND serves to detect neutrino interactions (especially \$\nu\_\tau\$) as well as any light dark matter scattering.

The **background strategy** in SHiP’s design is exhaustive: essentially *every known background source is shielded or tagged*. Neutrino-induced events (e.g. a \$\nu\_\mu\$ interacting in the decay volume air and producing a couple of tracks) are reduced by the light helium filling and can be tagged by looking for recoil activity in the veto layers. Random overlaps of beam muons creating fake vertices are handled by the muon shield plus requiring vertex consistency among multiple tracks. Cosmic rays are negligible underground. The goal is likewise **zero background** in \$10^{20}\$ proton-on-target - an enormous challenge, but simulation studies indicate it can be achieved with the combination of shielding and detector vetos.

In summary, **MATHUSLA is a large but relatively simple detector (no magnet, only tracking layers) with a focus on geometric volume**, whereas **SHiP is a complex, multi-system experiment** with magnetic spectrometry and calorimetry, reflecting the need to **precisely reconstruct** and characterize rare events in a high-background environment. These differences mean MATHUSLA is primarily a discovery detector - if an LLP decays inside, it signals new physics - whereas SHiP is both a discovery and an **analysis** detector, capable of measuring the properties of any new particle it finds to a high precision.

## Complementarity with Other Experiments

MATHUSLA and SHiP are part of a broader program to pursue LLPs at both energy and intensity frontiers. They are highly complementary not only to each other but also to existing LHC detectors and several smaller-scale experiments:

* **Within the LHC program:** ATLAS and CMS have ongoing searches for LLPs, but those are limited to decays occurring inside their detectors (few meters from the IP) or at most in their muon systems (\~10 m from IP). This leaves a *gap* for decays further out. MATHUSLA addresses this gap by extending coverage to \~100 m scales, **vastly extending the HL-LHC’s reach** in lifetime. In scenarios where ATLAS/CMS might see missing energy or displaced jets from a long-lived particle, MATHUSLA can catch the actual decay if it occurs outside the main detector. Additionally, other LHC-adjacent proposals target LLPs in certain regions: **FASER** (now operational in LHC Run-3) is located in the far forward line of sight of ATLAS and is sensitive to very light, fast-moving LLPs (like dark photons, axions) produced at small angles. **SHiP’s domain** (slow, feebly-coupled GeV-scale states) often involves wider angles, so FASER and SHiP actually cover different phase space - and MATHUSLA covers large angles at high mass, again complementary to FASER’s forward, low-mass focus. Similarly, **CODEX-b** is a proposed small decay volume (\~10 m scale) to be placed near LHCb, and **ANUBIS** a proposed detector in an LHC access shaft; these would also target LLP decays but with more limited coverage. **MATHUSLA’s much larger volume** gives it significantly more reach than CODEX-b (by orders of magnitude in rate for long lifetimes). Meanwhile, **LHCb** itself and **ALICE** can search for certain LLP signatures (especially LHCb for heavy neutrinos in \$B\$ decays at shorter lifetimes), but anything that decays outside their detectors is missed. Thus MATHUSLA acts as a **crucial catch-all for LLPs that escape standard LHC detectors**. It has been touted as "bolstering the HL-LHC’s ability to discover hidden sectors" as part of the official strategy discussions.

* **Within the CERN Neutrino/Intensity program:** SHiP emerged from the *Physics Beyond Colliders* initiative to use CERN’s SPS for new physics searches. It complements ongoing experiments like **NA62**, which searches for light particles (e.g. dark photons, axions) in rare \$K^+\$ decays and beam-dump mode at lower intensity, and **NA64**, which uses a electron beam to look for invisible decays (like \$A' \to \text{invisible}\$). SHiP’s reach for LLP decays is far greater than NA62’s in the sub-GeV range due to its much higher yield and dedicated design (NA62 is limited by  kaon production and background, whereas the BDF will produce all species in volume). Additionally, CERN is considering a successor to NA62 (the HIKE program) which might also do beam-dump runs, but SHiP’s 400 GeV proton setup with a dedicated detector is a **more powerful, broad approach**.

* **Other facilities worldwide:** The quest for long-lived particles is global. For instance, at Fermilab, experiments like **MiniBooNE** and **SBND** have been used to search for dark sector particles in beam dumps, and the proposed **LongQuest/DarkQuest** (using the 120 GeV Main Injector beam) aims for some sensitivity to dark photons and HNLs. However, the SPS with 400 GeV protons and a purpose-built SHiP detector offers higher energy and intensity, giving it the edge especially for heavier hidden particles and tau-coupled particles (e.g. \$\nu\_\tau\$ sources) - something Fermilab’s lower-energy beams can’t match. Meanwhile, **Belle II** (SuperKEKB) is exploring LLP signatures in \$B\$-meson decays, which can cover some of the same HNL or dark photon parameter space, but with much smaller statistics (Belle II’s \$B\$ yield is large \~\$10^{10}\$, yet SHiP’s charm yield will be \$10^{15}\$!). Thus SHiP will surpass flavor-factory experiments in sensitivity to invisibly decaying light particles by orders of magnitude in coupling.

* **Mutual MATHUSLA-SHiP complementarity:** The two experiments together would provide overlapping coverage in certain intermediate regimes, serving as cross-checks for one another. For example, consider an LLP of mass \~5 GeV that mixes feebly with the Higgs and thus is produced both in rare \$B\$ decays (at SHiP) and possibly in exotic Higgs decays (at LHC). If it has a proper decay length of a few tens of meters, **SHiP might observe a few decays** (since many are produced, but most live too long to decay in 50 m), while **MATHUSLA might also catch a few** (fewer produced in LHC, but a higher chance to decay in the \~100 m flight to MATHUSLA). A discovery in one would strongly motivate the other: for instance, a SHiP discovery of an HNL at \~1 GeV could prompt dedicated searches in LHC data or MATHUSLA for any heavier analogues or production in Higgs decays. Conversely, a MATHUSLA discovery of a complex Hidden Valley (multiple decay channels) would be largely out of SHiP’s reach, but SHiP could probe whether a lighter remnant of that hidden sector (like a dark photon mediator) is also present. Together, they ensure that CERN’s future program **leaves no stone unturned** in the search for LLPs across a huge range of masses and lifetimes.

As highlighted by the Physics Beyond Colliders studies, a **diverse portfolio** of experiments is essential for hidden sector searches. Many proposals - e.g. FASER, \[email protected], CODEX-b, AL3X, ANUBIS, milliQan, FORMOSA - cover specific niches at the LHC, and **SHiP at the SPS extends the reach beyond what LHC-based experiments can do**. MATHUSLA, being the largest of the LHC-based concepts, maximizes the HL-LHC coverage in concert with these smaller detectors. In the next decade, **MATHUSLA (if approved and built for HL-LHC Run 4)** and **SHiP (planned to start data-taking around the same period, \~2030)** will significantly augment CERN’s ability to discover new physics. They are complementary in that MATHUSLA leverages the **energy frontier (14 TeV collisions)** with a zero-background LLP detection, while SHiP leverages the **intensity frontier (high-\$N\$ beam dump)** with both discovery and detailed characterization potential. Each also complements ongoing experiments elsewhere: for example, MATHUSLA’s approach could be applied at future colliders (FCC-hh or CEPC) to continue LLP searches at even higher energies, and SHiP’s approach could be mirrored by proposed experiments like the **Big Fixed-Target searches at future high-intensity accelerators**. But currently, **at CERN, MATHUSLA and SHiP represent our best shot at uncovering long-lived new particles** that have so far evaded detection. By covering vastly different regions of parameter space and employing different techniques, **together they ensure a broad, comprehensive search for new physics** in the *coming era*.
